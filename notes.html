TODO's
1. Standarize the width and height with global variables
2. Structure collision for each element (validate game.js) 
    - player -> spider (game over) // to figure out later on the project

space between shoots (player.js / im using set timeout is good?)

smooth horizontal move
bug collision (check / is overlaping one bug into other)
start/pause/gameover layer (advanced / review approach)

levels plan to user game.start() pass attributes speed/#centipedes and score until that moment

EXTRAS
other bugs
sound
language
multiplayer? (socket.io)
