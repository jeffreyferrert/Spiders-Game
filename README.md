# Spiders-Game
I'm going to be working on a Centipede like replica (Atari - 1982) with spiders as the main characters. this is a fixed shooter arcade video game and the objective is to shoot all the spiders that comes from the top to the bottom as a row. the board fill with random blocks and the speed of the game will increase as the game progress. on the top we will have the score and lives available for the player

# Functionality & MVPS
In the project the user will be able to :
<ul>
  <li>move freely through the screen and play agains the spiders in randomly generated scenarios</li>
